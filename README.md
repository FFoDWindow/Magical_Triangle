# Magical_Triangle

We'll draw a "Magical Triangle". The first step is to divide every edge of an isosceles triangle in parts of consistent length. This is meant by "fineness" in the demo. After that we will connect every resulting point with it's equivalent on the other edges. 
I used the great d3.js and especially forceSimulation().
